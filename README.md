Tell us what we could pray for you!

## Introduction to pray!
Pray is a web application that lets you write what we can pray for you.

## Removing your pray ticket.
You might sent a wrong pray ticket or you want to edit or something else makes you want to delete your ticket. 
But sadly, you must contant Casper by casper@casperstudio.cf to remove your ticket.

## Limit
This project is save on a database. But there is a limit of it.
What limits does Database have?
The limits are currently:

- 50 MB per database (sum of keys and values)
- 5,000 keys per database
- 1000 bytes per key
- 5 MB per value

There are rate limits that apply to all operations. You will receive an HTTP 429 if you exceed them. We recommend you to content Casper with casper@casperstudio.cf as soon as possible. Thanks.

## Self-hosting

Please don't! At least now. The project is stll in development and it is very buggy. Which is why I haven't released yet. I will remove this until I fully done the development of this website. Thanks.
